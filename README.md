# **molprops** 🧪🔬

*A lightweight Python package for calculating molecular fingerprints and descriptors.*

**molprops** is a simple yet powerful Python package designed to compute various molecular properties efficiently. It integrates widely used cheminformatics tools like **RDKit** and **Alvadesc**, with planned support for additional descriptor methods such as **ECFP6**, **MAPS4**, and more.

Whether you're a computational chemist, bioinformatician, or just someone playing around with molecular data, **molprops** provides an easy-to-use interface for fingerprinting and descriptor calculations.

## **✨ Features**

✅ **Compute Molecular Fingerprints** (RDKit, ECFP6, and more)\
✅ **Generate Molecular Descriptors** (Alvadesc, MAPS4, etc.)\
✅ **Batch Processing** for multiple molecules at once\
✅ **Easy-to-Use API** for extending functionality\
✅ **Lightweight & Fast**, designed for minimal dependencies\
✅ **Compatible with Python 3.7+**, available via **pip**

## **🚀 Installation**

### **Install via pip**

```bash
pip install molprops
```

### **(Optional) Install via conda (if supported in the future)**

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge molprops
```

## **🛠 Usage**

### **Basic Example: Calculate Molecular Fingerprints**
@TODO
```python
smiles = "CCO"  # Ethanol
fingerprint = @TODO
print(fingerprint)
```

### **Compute Molecular Descriptors**
@TODO
```python

descriptors = @TODO
print(descriptors)
```

### **Batch Processing Example**
@TODO
